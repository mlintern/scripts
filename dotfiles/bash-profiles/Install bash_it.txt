Install bash_it

1. Check a clone of this repo: git clone https://github.com/revans/bash-it.git ~/.bash_it
2. Run ~/.bash_it/install.sh (it automatically backs up your ~/.bash_profile)
3. Edit your ~/.bash_profile file in order to customize bash-it.
NOTE: The install script will also prompt you asking if you use Jekyll. This is to set up the .jekyllconfig file, which stores info necessary to use the Jekyll plugin.
